# LOGFILE for the project of COMPARATIVE GENOMICS

## Author: Raul DURAN DE ALBA

### Before Thursday 27 November 2025

Found FISHTEDB in class, proposed Danio rero as it’s a model organism used to compare in humans immunological issues. We downloaded the TEs in from the website. Denys started a GitHub. I added the templates to work on the article and presentation on Latex. We met once in Mike’s and I house in order to work on the project and defined further advancement.

#### Problems

We thought we had to little TE´s. Only 2275 TE entries. We still wanted to continue using Danio rerio as it is a model organism.

### Thursday 27 November 2025

We met at Mike’s and I place to work on the project. We understood that the TE’s present on FishTEDB are referencing TE families (2279 TE families). There are around 4535283 TEs positions pairs in the reference Genome. Obtained by:

``` bash
wc -l /Users/raulduran/Downloads/Danio_rerio.age
```

We uploaded the documents to GitHub and faced commit issues. I had to rebase which complicated a previous push on the statistics of the reference genome Denys had committed previously. I will try to run the proteome database creation that Erine already executed.
