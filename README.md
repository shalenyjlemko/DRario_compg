## Duplicated genes 

The part on the Duplicated Genes is mainly based on the history of duplication of Danio rerio.
An Teleost Genome Duplication (TGD/3R) event happened a round 320-350 millions years ago and the impact is that zebrafish have more genes (~26,000) than humans (~20,000) largely due to this event.
It can be proved by one of the paper (presence of 7 Hox clusters (vs 4 in humans)).

Our Project's Goal: To distinguish between these ancient "Ohnologs" (via low-stringency BLAST) and recent tandem duplications (via high-stringency BLAST).

## Transposable elements

In this paper, they confirm that around 70% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish ortholog, and many human genes have two zebrafish counterparts (co-orthologs) due to the duplication event.

This paper proved the duplication by showing that while mammals have 4 Hox gene clusters, zebrafish have 7 (resulting from the duplication of the original 4, followed by the loss of one cluster).
