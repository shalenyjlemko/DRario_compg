**TE insertion time** was obtained using the formula T = K/2r
(35), which is widely used for the estimation of TE inser-
tion time (36, 37), wherein T represents the insertion time,
K represents the Kimura distance-based copy divergence of
TEs, and r represents the nucleic acid substitution rate. To
obtain the K value, we used the method (https://github.
com/4ureliek/Parsing-RepeatMasker-Outputs) developed by
Kapusta et al. (38) to convert the divergence value in the
RepeatMasker result (.out file) to the K value.
