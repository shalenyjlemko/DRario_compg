**TE insertion time** was obtained using the formula T = K/2r
(35), which is widely used for the estimation of TE inser-
tion time (36, 37), wherein T represents the insertion time,
K represents the Kimura distance-based copy divergence of
TEs, and r represents the nucleic acid substitution rate. To
obtain the K value, we used the method (https://github.
com/4ureliek/Parsing-RepeatMasker-Outputs) developed by
Kapusta et al. (38) to convert the divergence value in the
RepeatMasker result (.out file) to the K value.

**HOW TO EXPLAIN THE TE INSERTION PEAK**
Within teleost fish, elevated TE activity has been shown to coincide with species radiations in salmonids: [sauce](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-8-422#Sec12)

*DNA transposons gather mutations over time, resulting in vertical inactivation [33]. Eventually all that remains are relics of the original sequence; the majority of DNA transposons in genomes are no more than fragments and altered sequences. Therefore, most instances are remnants, and only those that have **recently been active can be found as intact or near intact copies**.*

Speciation and Adaptive Radiation: TE expansions might drive or accompany speciation events by promoting genetic diversification. Active transposons can cause insertional mutations and chromosomal rearrangements that lead to reproductive isolation

. The zebrafish lineage may have undergone a rapid speciation phase (perhaps related to the diversification of cyprinid fishes in the Paleogene), during which TEs were simultaneously active. In support, bursts of TE activity coinciding with species radiations have been documented in other fish groups: e.g., explosive adaptive radiations of African cichlids correlate with elevated TE content and new insertions

. Under this scenario, TEs could have contributed to genomic innovations in zebrafish (novel regulatory elements or genetic novelty) that facilitated speciation. Conversely, the genomic instability from active TEs might itself have fragmented populations (through chromosomal incompatibilities), spurring speciation. This is intertwined with the “genomic shock” idea since rapid environmental adaptation often underpins radiations.

**CHROMOSOME 4**
[reference](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12111)
The long arm of chromosome 4 is unique among zebrafish genomic regions, owing to its relative lack of protein-coding genes and its extensive heterochromatin. Chromosome 4 is known to be late-replicating and hybridization studies suggest that genomic copies of 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), which are not notably present on any other chromosome, are scattered along the long arm at high redundancy18. Immediately after the presumed centromere at approximately 24 megabases (Mb), the sequence landscape (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. A4) shows a remarkable increase in repeat content, which continues through to the telomere of the long arm. At approximately 27 Mb, the otherwise uniform presence of the satellite repeat SAT-2 on the long arm ends abruptly. This location is also the starting point of uniform MOSAT-2 distribution, a satellite repeat that is nearly absent from all other chromosomes but highly enriched on the long arm of chromosome 4.
