  abstract = {Marine planktonic eukaryotes play critical roles in global biogeochemical cycles and climate. However, their poor representation in culture collections limits our understanding of the evolutionary history and genomic underpinnings of planktonic ecosystems. Here, we used 280 billion Tara Oceans metagenomic reads from polar, temperate, and tropical sunlit oceans to reconstruct and manually curate more than 700 abundant and widespread eukaryotic environmental genomes ranging from 10 Mbp to 1.3 Gbp. This genomic resource covers a wide range of poorly characterized eukaryotic lineages that complement long-standing contributions from culture collections while better representing plankton in the upper layer of the oceans. We performed the first, to our knowledge, comprehensive genome-wide functional classification of abundant unicellular eukaryotic plankton, revealing four major groups connecting distantly related lineages. Neither trophic modes of plankton nor its vertical evolutionary history could completely explain the functional repertoire convergence of major eukaryotic lineages that coexisted within oceanic currents for millions of years.},

Surveys of their biodiversity have hitherto been geographically restricted and have not accounted for the full range of plankton size. We assessed eukaryotic diversity from 334 size-fractionated photic-zone plankton communities collected across tropical and temperate oceans during the circumglobal Tara Oceans expedition. We analyzed 18S ribosomal DNA sequences across the intermediate plankton-size spectrum from the smallest unicellular eukaryotes (protists, {$>$}0.8 micrometers) to small animals of a few millimeters. Eukaryotic ribosomal diversity saturated at \textasciitilde 150,000 operational taxonomic units, about one-third of which could not be assigned to known eukaryotic groups. Diversity emerged at all taxonomic levels, both within the groups comprising the \textasciitilde 11,200 cataloged morphospecies of eukaryotic plankton and among twice as many other deep-branching lineages of unappreciated importance in plankton ecology studies. Most eukaryotic plankton biodiversity belonged to heterotrophic protistan groups, particularly those known to be parasites or symbiotic hosts.},

Here, we survey the genetic diversity of airborne and surface ocean bacterial communities sampled during springtime transects across the northwest Pacific and subtropical north Atlantic as part of the Tara Pacific Expedition. We find that microbial community composition is more variable in the atmosphere than in the surface ocean. Bacterial communities were more similar between the two surface oceans than between the ocean and the overlying atmosphere. Likewise, Pacific and Atlantic atmospheric microbial communities were more similar to each other than to those in the ocean beneath. Atmospheric community composition over the Atlantic was dominated by terrestrial and specifically, dust-associated bacteria, whereas over the Pacific there was a higher prevalence and differential abundance of marine bacteria. Our findings highlight regional differences in long-range microbial exchange and dispersal between land, ocean, and atmosphere.},

Genetic libraries from larger size fractions ({$>$}3 \textmu m) of deep-pelagic water were mainly dominated by Dinophyceae, whereas small size fractions ({$<$}3 \textmu m) mainly revealed radiolarians and Syndiniales. In contrast, more specific opportunistic detritivores and grazers, mostly belonging to Stramenopiles and Cercozoa, were detected from water surrounding vent chimneys. Protist communities were different in the pallial cavity of the giant hydrothermal bivalves Bathymodiolus thermophilus and Calyptogena magnifica, dominated by Ciliophora (primarily belonging to Phyllopharyngea, Oligohymenophorea and Oligotrichea) and Cercozoa. Interestingly, protist communities retrieved from the pallial cavity liquid of hydrothermal bivalves were remarkably homogeneous along the Southern East Pacific Rise, in contrast to bivalves collected on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge hydrothermal vents and cold seeps from the Gulf of Mexico. Hence, complex protist communities seem to occur inside hydrothermal bivalves, and these metazoa may constitute a stable micro-niche for micro-eukaryotes, including grazers, detritivores, symbionts and potential parasites. From these communities, new lineages within the ciliates may emerge.},

By adopting a massively parallel tag sequencing strategy, we show that bacterial communities of deep water masses of the North Atlantic and diffuse flow hydrothermal vents are one to two orders of magnitude more complex than previously reported for any microbial environment. A relatively small number of different populations dominate all samples, but thousands of low-abundance populations account for most of the observed phylogenetic diversity. This ``rare biosphere'' is very ancient and may represent a nearly inexhaustible source of genomic innovation. Members of the rare biosphere are highly divergent from each other and, at different times in earth's history, may have had a profound impact on shaping planetary processes.},

Here, we investigated microbial activity off the California coast, 50--4000\,m water depth, using sensitive single-cell measurements of stable-isotope uptake and nucleic acid sequencing. We observed the highest yet reported proportion of active cells in the bathypelagic (up to 78\%) and calculated that deep-sea cells (200--4000\,m) are responsible for up to 34\% of total microbial biomass synthesis in the water column. More cells assimilated nitrogen derived from amino acids than ammonium, and at higher rates. Nitrogen was assimilated preferentially to carbon from amino acids in surface waters, while the reverse was true at depth. We introduce and apply the Gini coefficient, an established equality metric in economics, to quantify intracommunity heterogeneity in microbial anabolic activity. We found that heterogeneity increased with water depth, suggesting a minority of cells contribute disproportionately to total activity in the deep sea. This observation was supported by higher RNA/DNA ratios for low abundance taxa at depth. Intracommunity activity heterogeneity is a fundamental and rarely measured ecosystem parameter and may have implications for community function and resilience.},

  abstract = {Community composition within the human microbiome varies across individuals, but it remains unknown if this variation is sufficient to uniquely identify individuals within large populations or stable enough to identify them over time. We investigated this by developing a hitting set-based coding algorithm and applying it to the Human Microbiome Project population. Our approach defined body site-specific metagenomic codes: sets of microbial taxa or genes prioritized to uniquely and stably identify individuals. Codes capturing strain variation in clade-specific marker genes were able to distinguish among 100s of individuals at an initial sampling time point. In comparisons with follow-up samples collected 30--300 d later, {$\sim$}30\% of individuals could still be uniquely pinpointed using metagenomic codes from a typical body site; coincidental (false positive) matches were rare. Codes based on the gut microbiome were exceptionally stable and pinpointed {$>$}80\% of individuals. The failure of a code to match its owner at a later time point was largely explained by the loss of specific microbial strains (at current limits of detection) and was only weakly associated with the length of the sampling interval. In addition to highlighting patterns of temporal variation in the ecology of the human microbiome, this work demonstrates the feasibility of microbiome-based identifiability---a result with important ethical implications for microbiome study design.
